			"faq": [
				{
				"question": "How much do domains cost?",
				"answer": "Domains cost ~$5 USD today and renew every 5 years."
				},
				{
				"question": "How can I use domains?",
				"answer": "You can use your .BTC name to sign into hundreds of pre-existing decentralized apps and to send and receive STX. They also function much like traditional domain names. Compatibility via a web bridge with the DNS system of web 2.0 allows you to use a .BTC name for a business or personal site, however you'd like."
				},
				{
				"question": "How does it work?",
				"answer": ".BTC names are registered by sending a transaction to the BNS smart contract on the Stacks chain. BNS is the “Blockchain Name System”, a decentralised name registration app that can be compared to its Ethereum counterpart ENS. Once the transaction has gone through it will be finalized on Bitcoin. It means that .BTC names are fundamentally under your control and resistant to seizure or censorship."
				},
				{
				"question": "How many domains can I get?",
				"answer": "That depends on how deep your pockets are! However, there is a limit of one domain name per account. This is a technical limitation. If you somehow managed to purchase a name multiple times (by having multiple tabs open, for example) and are experiencing issues, then take a look at the FAQ below."
				},
				{
				"question": "I tried to purchase multiple domains with USD or BTC on the same account but only got one, what do I do?",
				"answer": "You can only own one domain per account, which means that later purchases will fail. If you used USD you should be refunded automatically, which may take up to a day. If you used BTC please contact us with details and we can initiate a refund."
				},
				{
				"question": "I tried to purchase multiple domains with STX but only got one and the other registration failed, what do I do?",
				"answer": "It is possible that you sent multiple preorders via the wallet while your name registration was pending. If this happens, then the later registrations will fail because you can only own one domain name per account. You can transfer the domain to a new account and then go back and complete the purchase for the second name. Enter it again in the search bar and it will give you the option to send the register transaction."
				},
				{
				"question": "What are the benefits to using a .BTC name?",
				"answer": "For starters, registering automatically gives you access to BTC and STX wallets. Names can be used to login to decentralized apps. You can redirect name.btc.us to your website. In the future, there can be better support for .btc resolution in browsers."
				},
				{
				"question": "Where does the source code live?",
				"answer": "BNS is open source and can be inspected in both the repository as well as on the Stacks chain directly."
				},
				{
				"question": "How does the web bridge work?",
				"answer": "The btc.us web bridge allows users to use their names as web pages. The web bridge turns btc.us into the top level domain and allows users to generate subdomains for their personal use. The web bridge is a centralized service, but .BTC names are not. In the future, there can be better support for .btc resolution in browsers. "
				},
				{
				"question": "What can I do when my name is taken or I believe that someone infringes on my copyright?",
				"answer": ".BTC names are registered on a first come, first serve basis, much like conventional domain names. However, since .BTC names are committed to the Stacks chain, there is no process to pursue a name that has been taken, other than negotiating with the owner. btc.us has no control over the domains nor the domain registration process and only functions as a gateway to the BNS smart contract. .BTC names do expire, so it is possible that a name becomes available at a later time."

It means that it is theoretically possible for someone to see your pending registration and try to grab the name before you can. A miner could, for example, ignore your pending name purchase and instead send a transaction to purchase the name for itself. A preorder does not reveal the name you intend to buy and mitigates this issue. However, if you prefer to have the name as quickly as possible and are willing to take the aforementioned risk, you can choose to send both transactions at the same time.</p>",
